Pricing Calculation:
Base Price:

Each uniform configuration starts with a base price (e.g., ₱500)
This is the minimum cost for the uniform
Additional Costs for Measurements:

Each measurement type (shoulder width, arm length, etc.) has:
A base size in cm (standard size)
A cost per extra cm beyond that base size
When a student's measurements exceed the base size:
Only the excess is charged: (Student's measurement - Base measurement)
This excess is multiplied by the cost per cm
Example: If shoulder base is 100cm, student is 103cm, and cost is ₱2/cm:
Excess: 103cm - 100cm = 3cm
Additional cost: 3cm × ₱2/cm = ₱6
This ₱6 gets added to the base price
Total Price: Base price + Sum of all measurement additional costs

Material Calculation:
Base Materials:

Each uniform has a set of base materials with fixed quantities
These are always used regardless of measurements (e.g., 50 units of red yarn)
Materials for Measurement Excesses:

Materials for measurements are only used for the excess portion beyond base size
Each material specifies a quantity per cm of excess (not per cm of total measurement)
If the student's measurement doesn't exceed the base, no additional material is used
Example: If shoulder width requires 5 units of material per excess cm:
Student measurement: 103cm (3cm over base)
Material needed: 3cm × 5 units/cm = 15 units
If there's no excess (student ≤ base), then 0 units needed
Total Material Usage:

For each material, the system adds:
Base material quantity (fixed amount)
Additional material from all measurement excesses
Example: 50 units base red yarn + 15 units for excess measurements = 65 total red yarn

Order Flow Logic ✅
The progression from pending → in progress → completed is appropriate for a tailoring business
Only pending orders can be edited/deleted, which maintains data integrity
Assignment of orders to tailors with proper tracking is well implemented
Material Calculation ✅
Your system correctly calculates materials needed based on:
Base materials for standard uniform sizes
Additional materials only for measurements exceeding base sizes
The material confirmation modal prevents assignments without sufficient inventory
Inventory deduction and transaction recording maintains accurate stock levels
Payment Handling ✅
The system properly handles full, partial, and refund payments
Payment status updates automatically based on amount paid vs. total
Receipt generation with QR verification is a nice security feature
Data Model Integration ✅
The connection between uniform configurations and orders is solid
Storing the student's measurements at order time is important (since measurements can change)
The materials calculation in both the uniform configuration and order management systems match
